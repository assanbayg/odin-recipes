        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>“Nauryz” in translation from the Persian language means “a new day”. In Kazakh language it means “a New Year”, “a Spring Holiday” or “a Great Day”. Sometimes it is called “A Milk festival”</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <p>The main dish of Nauryz, Nauryz-kozhe is made from seven ingredients. In the worldview of the Qazaq people, the figure “seven” is sacred. Therefore, the ingredients that make up Nauryz-kozhe are considered sacred. Let's stop on these ingredients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>500 g - meat (preferably horse meat (the best is kazy, if you can get it where you are) or beef or lamb. You can also mix them.</li>
            <li>100g - Barley</li>
            <li>50g - Rice</li>
            <li>1L - Kefir ( if you can get kefir then use natural yogurt mixed with some water or milk)</li>
            <li>50g - Noodles/Pasta</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Boil your meat products in sufficient amount of water (to cover the meat in the pot) for at least 2-3 hours. Readiness depends on the type of meat. Make sure to skim off foam that builds up when it just starts boiling. That gives you clear stock. When ready take out the meat.</li>
            <li>Have your barley half cooked by boiling it in salted (reasonably) water while the meat is being cooked. Then when the meat is ready pop it in together with grains.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles after rice and barley been in stock for 10-15 minutes. Give it 5 more minutes for the noodles to be ready. Best is to use home-made noodles. Some don’t like noodles in soup. So if you are one of them and don’t like it neither then just miss it out.</li>
            <li>Slice the meat up in smaller chunks and add it back to the pot.</li>
            <li>Let it all cool down a bit before you add the kefir. And voila. Enjoy your meal. Wait, did I tell you that it's nice cold.</li>
        </ol>
