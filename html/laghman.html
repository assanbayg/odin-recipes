            <h2>How to Make Laghman Stir Fry</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The goal is to fry all the ingredients separately and add them together in the end. The garlic is to be divided equally in all the ingredients, added towards the end of the frying time. Garlic is a finishing flavor, add it too soon, and the flavour will loose it's impact. Mum used 2 frying pans to fry things at the same time, this really sped up the process.</li>
                <li>Add oil to a hot frying pan and fry the beef until it's cooked. When the beef is cooked, add the tomato paste and fry for a few more minutes until its fully coated the beef and the tomato paste has cooked a bit. Add 1 tablespoon of Chinese black vinegar. Finish by adding some garlic in the last few minutes of cooking. Turn off the heat from this frying pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil and fry the onions until golden brown. Finish by adding some garlic in the last few minutes of cooking. Add the onions to the frying pan of beef.</li>
                <li>Add oil and fry the aspargus, flash fry it very quickly, for only 2 minutes, add about 1 teaspoon of garlic, mix for 1 minute, and add the asparagus to the frying pan of beef.</li>
                <li>Heat oil and fry green beans. Fry them for about 7 minutes, add garlic, mix and fry for a minute and add the green beans to the frying pan of beef.</li>
                <li>Turn the frying pan with the meat and vegetable mix back on high heat. Add the red peppers and fry them quickly together. Finish off the remaining garlic to the mixture. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li><li>Add a cup of boiling hot water. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for a few minutes. The colour of the water should have some red in it, from the tomato paste. If it doesn't then you didn't add enough tomato paste and the flavour won't have depth.</li>
                <li>Serve as soon as the Laghman noodles are ready. Remember to have the Chinese black vinegar available on
                     the table. Enjoy!</li>

            <h2>How to Make Laghman Pulled Noodles</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together the flour, egg, salty water, making a ball of dough. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes. To prevent the dough from sticking to the surface of the counter, mum put a tiny bit of oil on the counter and continued to knead the dough, instead of lightly dusting the counter with flour.</li>
                <li>Cut the dough into wide strips. Using your hands, roll into 8" strips that are about the thickness of your finger. Length doesn't really matter at this point, longer lengths are common, but shorter lengths are easier to handle. Lightly brush in oil, even as you are rolling and forming them into the strips. Keep them covered in oil to ensure they don't stick together. Place on an oiled plate or dish. If on a plate, coil into a circle, and continue each piece, until you have one large continuous coil. Alternatively, place them side by side in a dish and brush with oil. Cover with cling wrap so they don't dry out. Allow them to rest for a minimum of 4 hours. It's best to allow the dough to rest overnight. By allowing they to rest, they will stretch and pull into shape without tearing. Don't skip this step.</li>
                <li>Bring a large stock pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile start preparing the dough.</li>
                <li>This is the first part of this dough preparation. Take one strip of dough and using your hands, stretch and pull it. Holding the dough with your left hand, and pulling a few inches with your right hand, continuing until the piece of dough is stretched. It will start to look like a thick oily shoe lace. Keep each stretched shoe lace dough in an individual piles, not touching each other. While you are pulling, also twist at the same time. The technique is hard to master, so just pull, twist and pray for the best! Repeat this process twice, further stretching and twisting each individual dough lace. Cover them with cling wrap during this process, as they will start to dry out.</li>
                <li>The final time of stretching, you need to stretch the rope, while coiling it up like a rope, between your hands, maybe 2 feet apart. Another way to describe it would be to hold it with one hand, and loop it around the other, and continue until your noodle is looped. Then you hit the table gently but firmly with your noodle loop, aiming to hit the middle of the loop on the table. While you are hitting, you are also widening the gap between your hands. The end result is longer stretched noodles. Hang the noodles on the edge of the table until you are ready to cook them. It will take a few tries to get this to looks like noodles, and the shape will be irregular, and pieces might rip, but thats ok. It will all cook together in the same pot!</li>
                <li>The pot of water should be truly boiling by now. Drop the noodles in batches into the boiling water. Bring the water back to a boil and cook for about 2 minutes. Using a fork or chop sticks, break apart the noodles so they don't clump together while they cook. The oil on the noodles will help, and the oil washes off the noodles into the water, just like making pasta. After 2 minutes of boiling noodles, pull one out and taste. It should be al dente and firm.</li>
                <li>Prepare a bowl of cold water. When the noodles are cooked, remove from the pot using a mesh/wire noodle strainer, and place into the cold water bowl. This will stop the cooking process. Remove the noodles out of the cold water almost immediately, and serve with laghman stir fry.</li>
